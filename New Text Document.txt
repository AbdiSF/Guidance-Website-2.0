Welcome to Cooper High School, from the Guidance Office. Dawn Hinton (last name A-G), Stacey Guthrie (last name P-Z) and Lesley Vickers (last name H-O) are the guidance counselors and will be available to assist with personal issues, academics, and college/career planning. We are fortunate to have Mrs. Joy Appelman as our registrar. To see a counselor, you can send an email to Dawn Hinton, Stacey Guthrie, Lesley Vickers or Joy Appelman.

In addition, you may stop by the guidance office before or after school and leave your name with Mrs. Appelman. Students will be called to the guidance office as time permits in order of urgency. We are committed to responding to each of your needs and with your patience we will assist you as soon as possible.
